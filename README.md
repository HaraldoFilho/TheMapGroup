# The Map Group

Up to one day after you join this group, a discussion topic will be automatically created with a link for your map, so you can share it with anyone. The map shows all your photos at once, so it is easy to visualize all the places where you have taken a photo. Clicking on the markers you can see the photos taken on that location.
