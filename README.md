# The Map Group

Up to one day after you join this group, a discussion topic will be automatically created with a link for your map, so you can share it with anyone. The map shows all your photos at once, so it is easy to visualize all the places where you have taken a photo.

The maps are updated daily, so if you add photos to your photostream they will be added to the map until the next day.

Members can view maps from others and interact with each other, by posting comments to the map topic.

Members can also add photos to the group pool, which will be added to the group's map.
